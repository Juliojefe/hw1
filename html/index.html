          Before explaining what steghide 
          <sup id="ref-1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn-1" aria-describedby="footnote-label">[1]</a></sup>
          does and what it is, one must first understand that steganography 
          is “the art or practice of concealing a message, image, or file within another message, image, or file” 
          <sup id="ref-2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn-2" aria-describedby="footnote-label">[2]</a></sup>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Steghide is an open-source steganography tool that hides files within other files. This tool is versatile and can hide a 
          wide variety of file types. For example, it is able to hide video, audio, image, executable, and zip files, among many others. 
          It achieves this in a way that conceals the very existence of the embedded information. One limitation that Steghide has, 
          however, is that it only supports jpg, jpeg, and bmp image files and wav and au audio files as cover files. This means it 
          can hide essentially any kind of file within this slightly limited selection of cover files. This, however, is not a 
          major drawback because it does its job extremely well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Least significant bit encoding is used for hiding files, allowing for minimal distortion. Steghide also supports 
          Rijndael encryption 
          <sup id="ref-3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn-3" aria-describedby="footnote-label">[3]</a></sup>, 
          which is an advanced encryption standard algorithm with a user-defined password to 
          secure the data. This adds an extra layer of security, as even if the file is discovered to be hiding data, the data itself will 
          be encrypted, and only the correct password will reveal the content. Compression options are also available, allowing larger
          files to be hidden inside of smaller ones. Additionally, Steghide supports the extraction of files contained within other files, 
          given the correct password. In this way, Steghide is able both to hide files and to extract them, making two-way 
          communication possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          By virtue of being open source, anyone can inspect and modify its code. Furthermore, anyone can contribute to its 
          development. Because it is open source, it is maintained through community efforts.
